### Problem Statement

problem it come from government dataset has collect the minimum temperature on Singapore from year 1983 to 2023. The result show the effect global warming.

from this result it can show what is going on in the future, how to prepare to handle it,

### Datasets

For this project, I'll be using a number of weather datasets from data.gov.sg. These are:
1. **monthly_number_of_rain_days**: Measure of number of rainy days from 1982 to 2023
2. **monthly_rainfall_total**: Measure of monthly total rainfall from 1982 to 2023
3. **monthly_mean_surface_air_temperature**: Measure of monthly mean surface air temperature from 1982 to 2023
4. **monthly_mean_sunshine_hours**: Measure of mean sunshine hours 1982 to 2023
5. **monthly_mean_relative_humidity**: Measure of monthly mean relative humidity from 1982 to 2023
6. **hourly_wet_buld_temperature**: Measure of mean wet buld test from 1982 to 2023
7. **monthly_maximum_daily_rainfall**: Measure of number of maximun rainfall in daily from 1982 to 2023

Additionally, Using a table called Surface ait temperature max and min:
1. **monthly_average_air_temperature_max**: It's a measure of monthly household electricity consumption between 2005 and 2022 in kWh
1. **monthly_average_air_temperature_min**: It's a measure of monthly household electricity consumption between 2005 and 2022 in kWh

### Summary of Analysis

Base on scatter plot graph we seem a correlation of minimum temperature and Average of humidity that happen in Singapore,

The temperature likely increase in every year, if they don't do something to stop in the future is hard to living
